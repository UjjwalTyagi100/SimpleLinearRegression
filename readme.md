# Simple Linear Regression for Salary Prediction

This repository contains a project that demonstrates how to perform data preprocessing and build a Simple Linear Regression model to predict salaries based on years of experience.

## Table of Contents

1. [Introduction]
(# This project involves building a Simple Linear Regression model to predict salaries based on the years of experience. The steps include data preprocessing, model training, prediction, and result visualization.)

2. [Data Preprocessing]

   - [Importing Libraries]
   (# I used NumPy for numerical operations, Pandas for data handling, and Matplotlib for plotting.)

   - [Loading the Dataset]
   (# I imported the salary dataset and separated the features (years of experience) and the target variable (salary).)

   - [Splitting the Dataset]
   (# The data was split into training and test sets, with 80% of the data used for training and 20% for testing.)

3. [Simple Linear Regression]
   (# I used scikit-learn library to apply Simple Linear Regression.)

   - [Training the Model]
   (# I trained the Simple Linear Regression model using the training set.)

   - [Making Predictions]
   (# I used the trained model to predict the salaries for the test set.)

4. [Visualizing the Results]

   - [Visualizing Training Set Results]
   (# I plotted the training set results to compare the real salaries (red points) with the predicted salaries (blue line).)

   - [Visualizing Test Set Results]
   (# I plotted the test set results to compare the real salaries (green points) with the predicted salaries (blue line).)

5. [Conclusion]
(# This project demonstrates how to perform data preprocessing and build a Simple Linear Regression model to predict salaries based on years of experience. The visualizations help compare the model's predictions with the actual salaries, providing insights into the model's performance.)
